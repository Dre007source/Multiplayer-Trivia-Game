# ðŸŽ® Draw It or Lose It

CS 230 Portfolio Submission: The Gaming Room Software Design

 Project Overview
This repository contains the completed software design document for *The Gaming Room*, a project that demonstrates my ability to design scalable and secure software applications while addressing client-specific requirements. The design focuses on creating a cross-platform multiplayer trivia game, *Draw It or Lose It*, which extends the current Android-only version to work seamlessly across web and mobile platforms.

Client and Software Requirements
The client, *The Gaming Room*, required a responsive and scalable web application to:
- Host on a reliable and secure server capable of supporting thousands of simultaneous users.
- Ensure compatibility with multiple platforms, including Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android.
- Use cost-effective development tools while maintaining high performance and security standards.

 Reflection
 Strengths
One of the most successful aspects of my work was the clarity and structure of the software design document. I effectively detailed the system architecture, cross-platform considerations, and security measures. The inclusion of recommendations for tools like Docker and AWS S3, as well as the use of RESTful APIs, highlighted my focus on scalability and maintainability.

 What I Found Helpful
Creating a structured design document was incredibly helpful in visualizing the system before implementation. This process allowed me to identify potential challenges and prioritize key design elements like server scalability and security measures.

 Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise any part of this work, it would be the evaluation of alternative database management systems. Providing a more comprehensive comparison of options such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB would add depth to the recommendations.

 Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
To address user needs, I focused on scalability and cross-platform functionality to ensure the application could handle high user engagement across devices. User-centric design is critical because it directly impacts the overall success, usability, and adoption of the software.

 Approach to Software Design
My approach to designing this software was rooted in the following strategies:
- **Requirement Analysis:** Clearly defining the clientâ€™s needs.
- **System Visualization:** Using diagrams and tables to map out the architecture.
- **Iterative Design:** Incorporating feedback and refining the design incrementally.
- **Future Plans:** For similar projects, I plan to integrate rapid prototyping and iterative feedback loops to enhance the design process.
